# PingKeepAliveMonitor
Keep a rolling ping running to monitor servers, VPN's or other hosts and give visual, colorful feedback
This was adapted for use to monitor unreliable IPSec tunnels and also to keep them alive in the case that they take a while to come up for users in the morning naturally.

How to use:
- Edit the hosts.txt file with your IP's line by line to monitor and keepalive
- run the script
